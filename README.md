# About VRETCreator 
VRETCreator is a tool developed as part of a research project. It is developed for therapists to help create VR scenes that can be used for exposure therapy of phobia and anxiety.
It is possible to add 3D models that can represent triggers of anxiety-inducing phobias, or to act as scenery in the scene. 360 degree media (photos and videos) and sound can be added to enhance realism of the environment.
The patient will experience the scene created in VR through a VR headset.
