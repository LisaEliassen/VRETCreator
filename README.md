# About VRETCreator 
This project aims to simplify the process for therapists to create personalized VR exposure sessions for their patients by eliminating the requirement for expertise in VR development. Our application allows users to create personalized VR scenarios by incorporating personal 360Â° images or videos, adding models, that can represent the trigger for anxiety or phobia, with or without animations, and adding sound and scenery objects to the scene. Users can also save and load scenes, enabling efficiency, collaboration and reusability.
